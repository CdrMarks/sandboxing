note:
    VVV was one of, if not the, earliest implementations of Vagrant in the WordPress world. At the time, and currently, it used Bash scripting to build the entire server. This is easy to follow when you’re getting started, but isn’t very scalable - it targets one Linux distribution and is very fragile if anything updates in the ecosystem.
