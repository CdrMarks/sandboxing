##  Provisioning - Ansible

<img src="img/provision-ansible.png" />

note:
    Like Salt, Ansible is written in Python so you can extend it with typical Python code. Unlike Salt, most of Ansible’s commands are self-contained (so you don’t have to pull things from a remote server). Also, unlike Salt, Ansible can run against Windows machines, though you can’t run it with a Windows host - there are workarounds, and they’ve led to Ansible being a powerful distribution/build tool. Ansible has been around since 2012.
