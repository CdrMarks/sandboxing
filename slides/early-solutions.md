##  Early Solutions

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">WAMP</li>
    <li class="fragment">MAMP</li>
    <li class="fragment">XAMPP</li>
    <li class="fragment">Native Installations</li>
</ul>

note:
    Iâ€™ve worked with every solution in this list. My Windows machine once had WAMP installed before I moved to XAMPP before I just installed PHP and Nginx and MySQL natively. All of these are complete and utter messes, though.
