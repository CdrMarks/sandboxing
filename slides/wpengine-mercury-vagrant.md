</ul>

note:
    A popular WordPress host, [WPEngine](https://wpengine.com) has invested significant time and effort into both building their production environment _and_ a Vagrant-powered emulator for local development. They've also implemented [`vagrant push`](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/push) functionality, giving developers the power to take their local changes live instantly.
