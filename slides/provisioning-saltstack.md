note:
    Another project, [Salty WordPress](https://github.com/humanmade/Salty-WordPress) by [Human Made](https://hmn.md/), uses Salt as a provisioner. Salt is built in Python, so you can use Python scipts and dictionaries to pull things together. Itâ€™s very powerful. Salt has been around since 2011, so the community is young but growing.
