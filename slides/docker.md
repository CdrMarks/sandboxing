##  Docker

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">Build applications inside lightweight, distributable containers</li>
    <li class="fragment">Isolate key infrastructure components:
        <ul>
            <li>Web server</li>
            <li>Application</li>
            <li>Database</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">Easily distribute development environments to the team</li>
</ul>

note:
    Docker is the newest buzzword when it comes to building out scalable infrastructures. It's a tool that allows for accessible containerization of processes, empowering a true separation-of-concerns infrastructure and leading to insanely powerful scalability of hosted application systems.
