Sandboxing Your Development Environment with Vagrant
====================================================

Summary
-------

One of the newest tools on the market is an open source system called [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). Thanks to this amazing application, you can quickly and easily create a new virtual development environment at a moments notice. An environment that leaves your machine in pristine condition.
 
Viewers will witness how a few simple setup scripts - some in Bash, some in Ruby, some in Yaml - automate the creation of new PHP-based development environments, allowing all of us to move on from a managed \*AMP installation (or installing each of these tools natively on our machines).
